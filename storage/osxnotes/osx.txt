#AppleFontSmoothing
you can make OS X use a lighter text rendering style by running `defaults write -g AppleFontSmoothing -int 1` and either logging out and back in or quitting and reopening applications
1 corresponds to the "Light" setting that was included in System Preferences in 10.5 and earlier, 3 corresponds to "Strong", 0 corresponds to "Standard - Best for CRT", and 2 corresponds to "Medium - Best for Flat Panel"
0 corresponds to disabling LCD font smoothing (subpixel rendering) from System Preferences and 2 corresponds to enabling LCD font smoothing

#cron
the crontab format is described in `man 5 crontab`
cron adds a message to /var/mail/ when a command has STDOUT or STDERR output
you can disable the mail messages by adding MAILTO="" to the start of a crontab or by redirecting the STDOUT and STDERR of commands
`sudo rm /var/mail/$USER` removes existing mail messages
the default path is /usr/bin:/bin, but you can change it by adding a line like PATH=/usr/local/bin:~/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin to a crontab
the default shell is /bin/sh, but you can change it by adding adding a line like SHELL=/usr/local/bin/bash to a crontab
locale variables are unset by default for commands ran by cron, but you can change the locale by adding a line like LANG=en_US.UTF-8 to the start of a crontab
the root user has its own crontab which can be edited with `sudo crontab -e`
% has to be escaped as \% in the command field but \ does not have to be escaped as \\ unless it precedes %
@hourly is equivalent to `0 * * * *` and @daily is equivalent to `0 0 * * *`
at least in OS X, @reboot runs a command after restarting but not after logging out and back in
/etc/crontab uses a different format where the sixth field contains a username, like `* * * * * username command`
the files of crontabs are stored in /var/at/tabs/
/usr/lib/cron is a symlink to /var/at
/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.vix.cron.plist has /usr/lib/cron/tabs in QueueDirectories
`sudo tee -a /etc/syslog.conf<<<'cron.* /var/log/cron.log';f=/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist;launchctl unload $f;launchctl load $f` enables logging

#path_helper, /etc/paths, and /etc/paths.d/
/usr/libexec/path_helper adds lines in /etc/paths and /etc/paths.d/* to the path
path_helper is ran from /etc/profile, /etc/zsh.env, and /etc/csh.login
zsh reads /etc/zsh.env even for non-login shells but bash does not read /etc/profile for non-login shells
path_helper is not ran by graphical applications like Xcode, Script Editor, or Emacs.app
/etc/paths contains /usr/local/bin at the end by default
there are no files in /etc/paths.d/ by default, but for example the installers for XQuartz, MacTeX, and ImageMagick add files to /etc/paths.d/

#erasing an SSD securely
the option to erase a disk securely in Disk Utility has been disabled for SSDs since 10.7
according to a knowledge base article by Apple, erasing an SSD normally is secure enough and makes it difficult to recover data
it is still possible to run something like `diskutil secureErase 4 disk0s2` from Terminal on the recovery partition, but I do not know if that is more secure than erasing an SSD normally
another way to potentially erase an SSD securely is to turn on FileVault 2 before erasing the drive, but enabling encryption after an SSD has already been used is not necessarily secure either

#Internet Recovery mode
Internet Recovery mode is supported by all Macs that came with 10.7 or later and by some older Macs after a firmware update
in Internet Recovery the Mac downloads a disk image for the recovery system from Apple's servers and then starts up from the disk image
Internet Recovery mode can be used to install OS X on an empty drive after a drive is replaced or after a drive has been erased so that even the recovery partition is erased
option-command-R forces starting up in Internet Recovery mode

#startup keys
command-R starts from the recovery system
command-S starts up in single user mode
command-V starts up in verbose mode
shift starts up in safe mode
option opens Startup Manager
C starts up from an optical disk
D opens Apple Diagnostics or Apple Hardware Test
T starts up in target disk mode
holding P and R while holding option and command resets NVRAM or PRAM
holding eject or F12 or pressing a button on a pointing device ejects removable media like optical disks
option-command-R starts up in Internet Recovery mode

#resource forks
resource forks are not stored as extended attributes even though they can be accessed and modified through the extended attribute interface
`cat file/..namedfork/rsrc` or `xattr -p com.apple.ResourceFork file` shows the contents of a resource fork
`cat file/rsrc` stopped working in 10.7
`xattr -d com.apple.ResourceFork file` removes the resource fork of a file
`find . -type f -xattrname com.apple.ResourceFork` finds files that have a resource fork
resource forks are used to store information about aliases, custom icons set in Finder, the images of Icon\r files, file-specific default applications, and information in scpt files
the information in an alias file is stored in the resource fork and the data fork is empty, so that if the resource fork of an alias file is removed, the alias stops working
scpt files have resource forks that are used to store script objects, Script Editor window state, and the RTF descriptions of scripts

#AppleDouble files
AppleDouble files are used to store extended attributes, resource forks, ACLs, and file flags on non-HFS+ volumes and in archives
Archive Utility and /usr/bin/tar create AppleDouble files but /usr/bin/zip does not
zip archives created with Archive Utility include a __MACOSX directory for AppleDouble files
`COPYFILE_DISABLE= tar -cf folder.tar folder` creates a tar archive without AppleDouble files
`zip folder.zip -r folder` creates a zip archive without AppleDouble files
`ditto -c -k --sequesterRsrc --keepParent folder folder.zip` creates a zip archive that includes AppleDouble files
`ditto -x -k dir.zip` extracts a zip archive and convert metadata stored in AppleDouble files back to native formats
`find . -name ._\* -delete` deletes AppleDouble files
`dot_clean .` deletes AppleDouble files after converting the metadata stored in them to native formats

#Spotlight comments
a Spotlight comment added from Finder is usually stored both as an extended attribute and in a .DS_Store file
when a Spotlight comment is added from Finder for a file there is no write permission to, the Spotlight comment is not saved as an external attribute
a Spotlight comment that is not stored as an extended attribute is not indexed by Spotlight, even though it is shown by Finder if it is still stored in a .DS_Store file
if the .DS_Store file of a folder is deleted, the Spotlight comments of files in the folder are still indexed by Spotlight if they are also stored as extended attributes, but they are not shown by Finder

#default view modes and view options in Finder
the view mode that is used for new Finder windows is the view mode of the previously closed Finder window
I do not know any way to change the default view mode in Finder permanently
the "Always open in ... view" checkbox enables using a folder-specific default view mode for a folder which is saved in a .DS_Store file and which is changed every time the view mode of the folder is changed
if you check "Always open in column view" and change the view mode of a folder to icon view, the folder-specific default view mode saved in the .DS_Store file becomes icon view
the "Use as Defaults" button changes some of the settings in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Finder.plist
the settings saved with "Use as Defaults" are not used for folders that have folder-specific settings saved in a .DS_Store file
there is no "Use as Defaults" button in column view because the settings in the two bottom sections of the view options panel are the same for all folders in column view

#HFS compression
support for HFS compression was added in 10.6
HFS compression is enabled for many of the files that are installed with OS X
`sudo ls -lO /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users` shows that HFS compression is used for most of the default user accounts
most command line utilities and graphical applications display the uncompressed sizes of files, but you can see the compressed size of a file with `sudo fileXray --diskusage`
when a file is compressed, the data is stored in the resource fork and the data fork is empty
compressed files have a com.apple.decmpfs extended attribute that is not shown by xattr
`ditto --hfsCompression file1 file2` makes a compressed copy of file1 to file2
when file1 is compressed, `cp file1 file2` or `ditto --nopreserveHFSCompression file1 file2` makes a non-compressed copy of it as file2
`stat -f%f` prints 32 if a file is compressed and has no other file flags
`ls -lO` displays `compressed` if a file is compressed
Clusters.app can be used to enable HFS compression for user files

#folder actions
a folder action can be an AppleScript with an `adding folder items` handler or an Automator workflow created using the Folder Action template
Folder Actions Setup only allows selecting scripts and workflows in `~/Library/Workflows/Applications/Folder Actions/`
Folder Actions Setup modifies com.apple.FolderActions.enabled.plist and com.apple.FolderActions.folders.plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
the com.apple.FolderActions.folders job gets throttled if a folder with folder actions is modified within 10 seconds from the last invocation of the job
there are some example scripts in `/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/`
folder actions were reimplemented so that they use launchd in 10.5 and support for creating folder actions with Automator was added in 10.6

#using an OS X VM with VMware Fusion
you can create a VM from an OS X installer application downloaded from App Store
if you download a torrent for a version of OS X that is not available from App Store, just download an unmodified OS X installer application or disk image and not a modified ISO or VM image meant for PCs
installing VMware Tools adds support for other resolutions than the default resolution and for copy and paste between the guest and host
to restore the VM to the initial state later, take a snapshot before you start using the VM or after you install VMware Tools
to copy files between a VM and the host, add a shared folder from "Virtual Machine > Settings > Sharing"

#resampling filters for resizing images
sips and Automator use a method for resizing images that often makes images look blurry when images are downscaled
Preview used the same resizing method as sips and Automator in 10.7 and earlier but it was changed in 10.8
you can use a command like `convert input.png -filter lanczos2 -resize 500x output.png` to resize an image with ImageMagick in a way that does not require additional sharpening
the lanczos2 filter in ImageMagick is almost identical to the catrom filter and it is also similar to the bicubic option Adobe CS applications

#X11 font metadata files
X11 applications save font metadata files that are described in `man mkfontdir` to directories that contain fonts such as ~/Library/Fonts/
the files are not needed by normal OS X applications, and if they are deleted, they are recreated by X11 applications
`find ~/Library/Fonts \( -name fonts.dir -o -name encodings.dir -o -name fonts.list -o -name fonts.scale \) -delete` deletes the X11 font metadata files in ~/Library/Fonts

#disabling the notifications about new updates in 10.8 and later
you can disable the notifications about updates to OS X and App Store applications by unchecking "Automatically check for updates" from the App Store preference pane
unchecking only "Download newly available updates in the background" does not disable the notifications
if you disable automatic updates, you can install updates to OS X and App Store applications manually from App Store
`softwareupdate -ia` does not include updates for App Store applications and it can cause applications to crash if you do not restart after an OS X update

#EFI partition
the EFI partition is formatted as FAT and its size is about 200 MB
the EFI partition is initially blank and it is not used for booting, but it is used as a staging area for firmware updates
if the EFI partition is removed, the system starts up normally and Startup Manager still works, but firmware updates fail
`mkdir /tmp/efi;sudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /tmp/efi` mounts the EFI partition

#.CFUserTextEncoding
if ~/.CFUserTextEncoding contains 0x0:0x0, the default encoding is MacRoman and the default language is U.S. English
CFStringBuiltInEncodings in CFString.h contains the values used for the encoding
if the primary language is changed to Japanese from System Preferences, the contents of ~/.CFUserTextEncoding become 0x1:0xE
`printf 0x08000100:0 >~/.CFUserTextEncoding` changes the default encoding to UTF-8, but that has few benefits and has at least in the past caused problems with Adobe CS applications

#changes in 10.9
Network Utility.app was moved from /Applications/Utilities/ to /System/Library/CoreServices/
a password dialog is shown when using gdb
the wallpapers that were previously inside ScreenSaver.framework were moved to `/Library/Screen Savers/Default Collections/`

systemsetup requires superuser privileges

#new command line utilities in 10.9
powermetrics shows for example CPU package energy use and processes sorted by a weighted average of package idle wakeups and CPU use
systemstats shows for example periods with high CPU use in the past few days and most frequently launched processes
lsappinfo can be used to launch applications, to show information about running applications, and to change the properties of applications
footprint shows memory usage information
taskpolicy executes a program with altered I/O or scheduling policy
wdutil is a command line alternative to Wireless Diagnostics.app

#cached preferences in 10.9
when a property list file is edited directly or replaced with another property list file, quitting and reopening an application no longer applies the changes in 10.9
to apply changes to a property list file, run either `defaults read file.plist` or `killall cfprefsd` before quitting an reopening an application
for example `mv /tmp/com.apple.finder.plist ~/Library/Preferences;defaults read com.apple.finder;killall Finder` makes Finder use the settings in the new property list file
when a property list file is edited with defaults and not directly, just quitting and reopening an application still applies the changes

#spelling dictionary files
~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary applies to all languages, ~/Library/Spelling/en applies to U.S. English, and ~/Library/Spelling/en_GB applies to British English
when you press the button for learning a word in a spelling panel, the learned word is added to ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary when the spelling language is set to automatic
if you edit the files in ~/Library/Spelling/ directly, you can apply the changes by running `killall AppleSpell`

#.bash_profile and .bashrc
Terminal and iTerm 2 open new shells as login shells by default by executing a command like `login -pf $USER`, which makes bash read .bash_profile but not .bashrc
the terminal applications on other platforms often open new shells as non-login shells, which makes bash read .bashrc but not .bash_profile
tmux and the shell mode in Emacs open new shells as non-login shells by default, but when you ssh to an OS X installation, bash is invoked as a login shell by default
if you use ~/.bash_profile as your bash configuration file, you can run `echo '. ~/.bash_profile'>~/.bashrc` to make bash read ~/.bash_profile when bash is invoked as a non-login shell, and vice versa

#Time Machine
the "Restore Time Machine Backup" option on the recovery partition only allows restoring a backup made with the current Mac, but you can use Migration Assistant to restore a backup made with another Mac
Time Machine cannot back up Boot Camp or Windows partitions
the data for backups is stored in /Volumes/Data/*.sparsebundle/bands/ on network drives such as Time Capsules
Time Machine cannot back up network drives, which includes USB drives connected to a Time Capsule
when Time Machine inherits a backup, the computer name and the name of the startup disk are changed on the backup disk
since 10.7.2, backups saved on an external non-network drive have included a copy of the recovery partition which has a name like "Recovery 10-9" in Startup Manager
Time Machine sparse bundles can be read on Linux by using sparsebundlefs and tmfs
files on backups have extended attributes like com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineNewestSnapshot that are removed by `tmutil restore` and when the files are copied from Finder but not when the files are copied with cp
if `tmutil startbackup` results in a "Backup Disk Not Available" notification when you attempt to back up to a Time Capsule, try to turn the network connection off and back on from System Preferences

#local Time Machine snapshots
local snapshots were introduced in 10.7
local snapshots are enabled by default on laptops but not on desktop Macs
`sudo tmutil enablelocal` enables local snapshots, `sudo tmutil disablelocal` disables local snapshots, and `tmutil snapshot` saves a local snapshot
when Time Machine is turned off and back on, local snapshots get enabled on laptops and disabled on desktop Macs regardless of the previous setting
the files of local snapshots are stored in /.MobileBackups/ and in /Volumes/*/.MobileBackups/
/Volumes/MobileBackups/ is an mtmfs filesystem
the files in a local snapshot are not copied to a backup volume when a backup volume becomes available
10.9 keeps daily local snapshots for a week and a single additional weekly local snapshot, but 10.7 and 10.8 keep hourly local snapshots for a day and daily local snapshots for a week
local snapshots are not counted as used disk space in Finder but they are shown under backups in the About This Mac window
in 10.9 all local snapshots except the newest one are deleted if free disk space falls below 10%, but in 10.7 and 10.8 all local snapshots are deleted if free disk space falls below 20%

#/etc/bashrc
/etc/bashrc is not a startup file that is read directly by bash but it is sourced from /etc/profile in OS X
bash normally reads /etc/profile when invoked as a login shell but not when invoked as a non-login shell
in OS X /etc/bashrc includes `shopt -s checkwinsize` and a function that is used by Terminal to track the current directory

#using iTerm 2 in full screen
you can make iTerm 2 use custom full screen windows that do not have animations and do not use spaces by unchecking the "Native full screen windows" option
you can make iTerm 2 open in full screen by default by setting "Profiles > Window > Style" to "Fullscreen"

#differences between the mp4, m4a, m4b, m4p, and m4v filename extensions
the m4a, m4b, m4p, and m4v filename extensions were all introduced by Apple
the option to remember the previous playback position in iTunes is enabled by default for files with an m4b extension but not for files with an m4a extension
iTunes displays files with an m4b extension under audiobooks by default
according to the HandBrake wiki, QuickTime does not support AC3 audio, SRT subtitles, or chapters for files that have the mp4 extension but does for files that have the m4v extension, so that HandBrake uses the m4v extension when it creates an mp4 file that uses one of those features
m4a has the UTI com.apple.m4a-audio and the parent UTI public.mpeg-4-audio
m4p and m4b have the UTI com.apple.protected-mpeg-4-audio and the kind of m4b files is shown as "protected MPEG-4 audio" in Finder even though m4b files do not have to be copy-protected
m4p and m4b do not have public.mpeg-4-audio or com.apple.m4a-audio as parent UTIs
m4v has the UTI com.apple.m4v-video
mp4 has the UTI public.mpeg-4 and the parent UTI public.movie
